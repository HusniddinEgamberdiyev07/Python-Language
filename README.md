# Python Learning Repository

I am learning the Python programming language at **Samarkand International University of Technology (SIUT)**.  

This repository contains practice files covering topics I have learned so far, including:

- Variables
- Data Types
- Operators
- Lists
- Loops

Each file is a small exercise or example to help me understand and practice Python concepts.
